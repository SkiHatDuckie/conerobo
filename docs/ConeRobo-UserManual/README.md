# ConeRobo User Manual Specifications
This file contains all information relating to how the ConeRobo User Manual should be organized, added to, 
and maintained.

## Why does this manual exist?
The purpose of this manual is to give a reference explaining the features currently available to a user using
ConeRobo and to point out important configuration or troubleshooting advice.

## Who is this manual for?
This manual is for anyone who is using the ConeRobo software engine and the built-in features that come with 
it. Previous background with ConeRobo, or any other technical experience, is not considered.

## What should this manual cover? (and what it shouldn't)
The manual should function as a reference including any details or advice that may seem useful for anyone
using ConeRobo and its built-in features. This should not function as a guide or tutorial. Documentation
on components that are not built-in features of ConeRobo (anything that isn't a part of the ConeRobo repository)
should be explained elsewhere.
