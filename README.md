# ConeRobo
An idea for an interesting approach to machine learning.

Will Update this README as development continues. :]

## What is ConeRobo?
ConeRobo is not a single machine learning model, but instead an application for 
combining multiple programs and learning models in a modular fashion.

Features of ConeRobo will include:
- Sending data between various connected programs.
- Configuration scripts for specifying how ConeRobo should handle a program, 
without needing to modify the program itself.
- Terminal User Interface (TUI) and Graphic User Interface (GUI), for making 
monitoring, setup, and running of multiple programs easy.
- Possible UI creator for specific programs.
- Recoving from failures and handling errors.
- ...And more things that I either can't remember or don't have the right 
words to best explain.

This is easily my most ambitious project, so work will likely go well into my
years in college. This is also a passion project, meaning that a lot of things 
will likely change over time. As of writing this, however, I am very willing to 
make this a real thing, and if anyone has suggestions or questions for me, please 
tell me! [SkiHatDuckie@gmail.com]

## Current Task:
Creating different classifiers to read handwritten digits to teach myself 
programming in rust, and machine learning algorithms in general.

This is not necessarily what ConeRobo is going to be, and this code will 
likely be moved to it's own repository later on. However, I feel like this 
could be used as a reference for when I do begin making ConeRobo.
