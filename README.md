# ConeRobo
An idea for an interesting approach to machine learning.

Will Update this README as development continues. :]

## What is ConeRobo?
ConeRobo is an application and software engine that can be used to combine, 
run, and monitor several different programs, all in a modular fashion.

It acts as the core and entry-point of any project that uses it. Programs are 
added as modules, or “components”, to ConeRobo. Communication, global storage, 
and the movement of data is handled by the application.

The focus of ConeRobo is to create a reliable base for complex 
automation/robotics/AI projects.

This is easily my most ambitious project, so work will likely go well into my
years in college. This is also a passion project, meaning that a lot of things 
will likely change over time. If anyone has suggestions or questions for me, please 
tell me! [SkiHatDuckie@gmail.com]

## Current Task(s):
- Experimenting and creating a prototype for a TUI.
- Finalizing the list of major features that I want ConeRobo to be capable of doing.
- Determining the project structure of ConeRobo / how ConeRobo will function.
